This project is a real-time chat application built with a React + TypeScript front-end and a .NET 8 ServiceStack API back-end.

Users can register, log in, create channels, join channels, and exchange messages.

The API uses AutoQuery, OrmLite, and PostgreSQL, while the client communicates via JSON endpoints with session and JWT authentication.

The UI runs on Vite, includes protected routes, and uses toast notifications for feedback.
